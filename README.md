# GiphyApp

This app allows the user to see a page full of gifs from their favorite video games.
Simply click the pre-rendered buttons to display gifs of the corresponding title.
Gifs will appear static on the screen until the user clicks on them. Click them a second time to stop the animation. 

Even better, the user can add their own buttons to the page with the "Add your favorite game" feature. 
All additional buttons will function exactly the same as the pre-rendered buttons.

This app is also mobile-friendly.
